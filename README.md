Initialization of Game Master Folder

This repository is dedicated to holding the group unity project for udel art200 winter 2016 project 'cecil the cell'

The project is contained in the assets and projects setting folder, though a new project should be made and those folders should be imported to correctly implement the build.

To create a copy of this project :
1. download github and clone this project.
2. create a branch of this project.
3. In Unity, select open project.
4. choose the folder that you just created.
5. create changes to the project.
6. create a pull request on github when you are done.
7. repeat when when major changes are made.

This process is rather involved, but it will keep the project current between classes.
If that doesn't work out too well, you can download the project and just open it in unity without using github and try and keep the changes in a separate folder.  
There is also a TODO list in the folder for anthing that you want to be put into the game, please add whatever you want.
Best of luck with the art!
